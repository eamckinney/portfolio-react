Twenty feet of crimpy climbing brings you to the cruxes.  The first is a delicate, improbable cross through off a flat undercling sloper.  The sloper can\'t really be grasped, just pushed up on by standing up, and crossing through seems ridiculous until you finally commit and go for it.  Many people, particularly those of a shorter stature, end up lunging at the end of the cross through; luckily the pockets you\'re reaching for are two of the most improbably perfect jugs you\'ll ever encounter on a route.  Shake out and clip from the jugs, then go for the next crux; a huge deadpoint dyno to a flat edge three or four feet above the holes.  This hold must be hit perfectly to prevent you\'re feet from popping off the nonexistent smears for feet.  Once through the second crux, easier climbing featuring a fist jam rest, the world\'s best two finger pocket, and a couple of perfect oxide crimps lead to one last long move to a jug at the anchors.","style":["crimpy","technical","slopey","juggy","undercling"]},{"id":105826937,"name":"Number 6 a.k.a.

Very technical, crimpy, and pumpy; it climbs like a series of difficult boulder problems with hard moves coming all the way to a potentially bitter end.  Like many of the harder routes at the bluff this one seems much harder until you figure out all the little tricks.  Down low a long lockoff to a fingerlock sets you up for the first crux; either a big reach out left to bump off a very poor gaston or a wild three foot deadpoint all the way to the great incut edge up high.  A few more tricky moves brings you to an excellent rest just left of Barnburner.  The next fifteen feet of intense climbing takes you through a big stab out left for a pocket, powerful laybacking, and finally the crux of the climb: a traverse left to a decent rail.  For those fortunate few over about 6\'3\\" or with a ridiculous ape-index, the rail can be reached all the way from the decent holds out right.  Everyone else must bump using a slopey sidepull/pinch, a perpetually slimy crimp, and some worthless footholds with the difficulty inversely proportional to your height.  The sustained nature of this section makes it very tiring to link because of the difficulty of clipping the bolts.  A better option is to clip high and downclimb back to the good rest, then climb all the way from the jug to the rail without stopping, then clip the bolt at your knees.  This way saves precious energy but requires a little more psyche as you contemplate the whipper while crimping the life out of that slimy edge!  Once through the crux, it\'s not over yet.  Another difficult boulder problem from the rail finally gets you to a hold worth writing home about.  Ten more feet of moderate climbing leads to the anchors and, for most, the exhilarating experience of clipping the chains pumped out of your mind.

Power past the crux and steady your way to the top while fighting the pump!","style":["crimpy","pumpy","powerful"]},{"id":105825163,"name":"New Kids on the  Rock","type":"Sport","rating":"5.10d","stars":3,"starVotes":62,"pitches":"","location":["Minnesota","Barn Bluff (Red Wing)","Winter Wall"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105825163/new-kids-on-the-rock","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106224562_sqsmall_1494089603.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106224562_small_1494089603.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106224562_smallMed_1494089603.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106224562_medium_1494089603.jpg","longitude":-92.5211,"latitude":44.569,"climbingArea":"Minnesota, Twin Cities & Central Region","desc":"This climb goes up the nose that is 10 feet to the left of Jump Start.

There are certainly some harder climbs at the bluff, but none personify so well the nature of hard climbing at Red Wing; incredibly crimpy, super technical, and very temperature dependent.  The first 50 feet are incredibly sustained, with no real letup until you reach the jug at bolt six; from there to the top is relatively easy 5.10 climbing with ample opportunity to depump before sneaking through the band of choss on top to reach the anchors.  The bottom two thirds of the route consists of three very difficult boulder problems, each one harder than the last, linked by easier but extremely technical terrain.  The first powerful, crimpy boulder problem gets you to the second bolt and the bottom of the distinctive seam/crack that diagonals up the lower part of the wall.  The seam consists of super techy 5.11+ that may seem impossible until you find the right sequence of microscopic footholds to see you through.  At the end of the seam, the next boulder problem tackles a powerful gaston and match on a slopey rail to reach the large pocket which is much worse than it looks.  Make the difficult clip from the pocket, then move left to reach the \\"rest\\" at a four inch long, incut crimper.  I would not consider this a rest on any other route, but you take what you can get and this is far and away the best hold between the ground and the jug at 50 feet.  Shake out as best you can before tackling another ten feet of awkward, technical 5.11 climbing to reach the ultimate crux of the route and the hardest individual moves, right after the fifth bolt.  There are numerous sequences for the last boulder problem, but they invariably all use the same razor sharp 1/4 inch crimper, tiny iron oxide gaston high and right, and some combination of worthless ripples and pockets as intermediates to reach the flat, positive crimper that finishes this V5 sequence.  Bearing down on the sharp holds enough to stick the last moves as your forearms reach meltdown is, needless to say, a good test of pain tolerance and tenacity.  Two more big reaches will bring you to that \\"thank god\\" jug out right and the end of the difficulties.  Due to the thin, crimpy nature of this route, it\'s highly temperature dependent and nearly impossible during the humid summer months.  There has been some debate as to the grade of this route, given 12d in Farris\'s guidebook.  Everyone I talked to who has done this route or come close, with the exception of one, felt strongly that it warrants the bump to 13a.  In comparison to other hard Red Wing routes such as Living All Over Me and Mississippi Burning that are considered solid for their grades, Paradigm was a huge leap in difficulty and seems deserving of the bump.  It would be great to see more traffic on this route and a few more opinions about the grade.  Whatever the rating, the route is a classic and deserves to see more attention.","style":["crimpy","technical","slopey","crack","juggy","pumpy","powerful"]},{"id":105831494,"name":"Geriatric Sex Maniacs from Mars","type":"Sport, TR","rating":"5.10c","stars":2.7,"starVotes":66,"pitches":1,"location":["Minnesota","Barn Bluff (Red Wing)","Annadonia Area"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105831494/geriatric-sex-maniacs-from-mars","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106547124_sqsmall_1494119235.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106547124_small_1494119235.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106547124_smallMed_1494119235.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/106547124_medium_1494119235.jpg","longitude":-92.5211,"latitude":44.5693,"climbingArea":"Minnesota, Twin Cities & Central Region","desc":"This route is located in the corner about 20 feet to the left of Annadonia.

Start up the crack until you can reach left and clip the first bolt.  At this point it is possible to move out onto the arete proper and begin the real climbing.  A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux, one of the best sequences you\'ll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling, the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock, the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released, but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right, leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately, clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence, necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though, as a large fall is risked on a very short climb, and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly, and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!  However you choose to do it, Kelly\'s Arete offers some of the bluff\'s most aesthetic climbing and should be high on everyone\'s ticklist.","style":["technical","slopey","crack","undercling"]},{"id":105831485,"name":"Femme Fatale","type":"Sport, TR","rating":"5.12c","stars":4.5,"starVotes":17,"pitches":1,"location":["Minnesota","Barn Bluff (Red Wing)","Annadonia Area"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105831485/femme-fatale","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/109668391_sqsmall_1494359536.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/109668391_small_1494359536.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/109668391_smallMed_1494359536.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/109668391_medium_1494359536.jpg","longitude":-92.5211,"latitude":44.5693,"climbingArea":"Minnesota, Twin Cities & Central Region","desc":"Moist most of the time.

Seriously?! Come on, MN! I know it isn\'t the Eiger, but this thing is fun. I\'m leaving again in about a year, and it would be nice if someone repeated this (and downgraded it to 12a) before I left. Someone step up for god\'s sake.     So the description I wrote in 2007:  The solid, orangey gold rock to the left of Fallen Knight: it consists of three small boulder problems where each one is harder than the last.  Starts with easy climbing up to a thin seam, which can be surmounted using a horizontal hand jam below, and making a high reach to good holds.  An easy deadpoint leads to a horizontal crack.    The next section is the most fun - long reaches between a blank arete and a couple of sloping crimps, with the wall steadily tilting a little more overhanging as you go.  This sets you up for the final six feet, and the crux, which involved some serious tomfoolery, not to mention a couple of weeks of doubt as to whether I would be able to do it.  Figuring out these moves was the most rewarding part of the process of putting up this route, so I\'ll leave the details out, but make sure to pull a couple of techy moves out of your quiver for the crux.   The last move is a nice little throw to the positive finish, and a boulder-style topout.  The grade is just a guess - it isn\'t as painful as nearby Genetic Control, but was harder for me, and took a little longer.    A fun toprope on good orange rock that doesn\'t feel like most of the Taylor\'s Falls stuff.  Ultimately, this is a route of entirely different character than anything else at the crag (and MN), and now a personal favorite.

Since it was first climbed, it has been top-roped countless times, led once (Mike Dahlberg - early 90\'s(?) - before the awesome thin cams of today), and bouldered (Andy Raether ~2001 - a bold ascent, given the landing [update: Word on the street (Adam Therneau) says that Nic and Chris H have also bouldered it - anyone else?]).  With appropriate equipment, sound judgment, and motivation, this route is accessible to many more climbers in any of the three styles.   Although short, it contains some of the most enjoyable movement of any route in the state.  The rock is solid, the holds are finger friendly (for a 12), and the spacing and position of the holds are not so outrageous that they disallow the emergence of character.    It\'s one of the easiest set-ups around too, with a five minute walk to the short cliff, a two minute walk to the top, and a five minute set-up.

Begin in front of the jagged splitter crack on the Big Rock\'s north-facing side (toward the swamp). This climb goes up the right-side arete. Use the obvious flat jug on the base of the arete as a sit start hold. Your 1st left foot is across the crack/gap and the 1st right foot is on the face you\'ll be climbing. For this route to be a V1 layback, use only the left edge of the arete for hands while keeping feet solely on the main boulder face off of arete/corner holds. Arete footholds while temping here, can throw your balance off and toss you into a set of jagged offwidth jaws. Ouch. Flagging a foot across the gap can be helpful at times though.  After pulling through a pinchy sit start sequence, the layback begins, making for solid, almost relaxed climbing up the boulder\'s side to a great topout hold - ends on a flat jug near the top.

Two recent sends (the most notable being Tyler Hoffart\'s second ascent 16 years after the first), however, have proved this thing not only goes, but is a great big ball of fun to climb as well. The line begins on an easy, left trending ramp to the far left side of the winter wall (think near NSP, Relentless, etc.). Basically, its the closest climbable line to the gully separating the winter wall and cyclops areas. You\'ll figure it out. After climbing the 5.5 ramp, take a break on the pedestal on top, then traverse right on two huecos into a sequence that seriously deserves a V-grade. Complete about 10 feet of hard, cool climbing which becomes rapidly more difficult as you move through it, until two stopper moves and an airy reach to a ledgy jug ends any difficulties. After a loud and energetic celebration (I think I screamed \\"Yes!\\" like 10 times), move up and right through slightly chossy 5.9 terrain to old anchors (shared with \\"Longing for Miss Adonis\\").

We usually climbed it in the dark with hiking boots, too worn out from laps on Barn Burner to even bother switching to climbing shoes.     It is still a fun climb, and a safe, but challenging lead for the novice 5.9 leader. The climb runs left of the bolt line on Roof Burner, climbing the left corner of the roof, moving directly up and sharing the Roof Burner bolts. At the last bolt, there is an intimidating but fairly simple (5.7) left angled upward traverse to the Barn Dance anchors. From here, you can toprope Dead Dog Face if you so desire. From the last bolt you can also move right instead to finish on the Roof Burner anchors.     Alternately you can use the bolts on Dead Dog Face, but the last bolt takes you a long way off of the Barn Dance line.     Some feel the crux is pulling the roof, others find it in the dirty pockets following the roof. In either case, the holds are there, you just have to find them...     FYI, there is an alternate finish to the Roof Burner Bolts that is longer and also probably 5.9.  It seems many people are climbing that as Roof Burner, but they are not the same route.

All should pause at one of the many comfortable rests to take full-advantage, soak in the amazing view of the valley below, lean back, take a deep breath, look up at the sky and laugh at the world for a few seconds.

Having taken the left crack system, climbers will find themselves deposited on a comfortable ledge, where they will encounter another ledge to their left, separated from the main wall by a #3.0 C4 size crack (a long sling is useful here). From this ledge, a two or three move sequence provides a final, but tenuous, upper-crux. The further left the climber stays the more difficult this sequence is.     After surmounting the \\"headwall\\" a move or two on blocky terrain deposits the climber at the base of a giant boulder.

After arriving in the v-slot it is possible to finish up-and-right to the ledge above Orgasm (where the easier anchor setup is), or go direct up overhanging blocky holds (depositing the climber on a ledge with few choices for anchoring).    Foreplay can be protected extremely well, and would make an excellent first-lead for a competent toproper ready to take the next step. This is all-the-more true given that it has several opportunities (the ledges) to rest and fully recover (or even possibly escape to easier terrain) as well as the opportunity to sling what seems to be a solid tree for protection at the first ledge. First-time leaders would be well-advised to use the right-hand finish.","style":["crack","overhung"]},{"id":105730538,"name":"PushMi, Pull-Yu","type":"Trad, TR","rating":"5.6","stars":3.7,"starVotes":124,"pitches":"","location":["Wisconsin","Devil\'s Lake","East Bluff 04 - East Rampart","11: Bill\'s Buttress"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105730538/pushmi-pull-yu","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/107071558_sqsmall_1494163688.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/107071558_small_1494163688.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/107071558_smallMed_1494163688.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/107071558_medium_1494163688.jpg","longitude":-89.7141,"latitude":43.4137,"climbingArea":"Wisconsin, Central Region","desc":"Push-Mi, Pull-Yu is located on the long southeast face of Bill\'s Buttress.

Michael\'s, like Peter\'s, has a low crux that leads to easier, aesthetic climbing above. Unlike Peter\'s, a route that is adored by all, Michael\'s inspires strong opinions in both directions. Simply put, climbers either love Michael\'s or they hate it.From the base, Michael\'s appears to be an appealing, straightforward crack system, that forms the line of weakness up an impressive wall. But then, from the base, it is easy to look past the start. Reviewing the comments below (or even the entire forum, Michael\'s Project:  Timeless classic or horrific sandbag?, on the subject) will give the aspirant climber quite an education in the variety of opinions surrounding the quality of climbing to be found at the beginning of Michael\'s. Almost everyone who has climbed Michael\'s, will agree that the start is awkward, wide, polished and often slimy. The disagreement about Michael\'s concerns whether the climbing beyond the start properly compensates the climber for what he or she endured to get there.Having groveled (and there really is no other word for it, except maybe \\"thrutched\\") up the difficult, off-width, inside-corner start, the climber can reach back-and-to-the-right, latch a jug just around the corner on the face left of Callipigeanous Crack (continuing straight up the inside corner would place the climber on Kamikaze - a dubious proposition indeed). After establishing on the right-hand face, the climber is richly-rewarded with the route he or she had expected in the beginning. Good holds on the face lead the climber up to where it is possible (and indeed, desirable) to head back into the corner and continue to the top on solid jams. The route finishes in a narrow hanging gully.In the end, an ascent of Michael\'s Project (especially on the sharp end) is a rite of passage for all DL climbers. So, grab a rope, a rack, a willing partner and get out there to experience Michael\'s for yourself. Only then can you add your voice to the cacophony of firmly-held opinions. Love it or hate it, you\'ll never forget it.","style":["crack","juggy"]},{"id":105730637,"name":"Boy Scout","type":"Trad, TR","rating":"5.3","stars":3.5,"starVotes":77,"pitches":1,"location":["Wisconsin","Devil\'s Lake","East Bluff 04 - East Rampart","06: Gill\'s Buttress"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105730637/boy-scout","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/4300799_sqsmall_1557853641.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/4300799_small_1557853641.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/4300799_smallMed_1557853641.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/4300799_medium_1557853641.jpg","longitude":-89.7128,"latitude":43.4136,"climbingArea":"Wisconsin, Central Region","desc":"This route is best is best when simul-climbed or soloed, unless you are a boy scout.

Instead, protect below the overhang (extend your sling!) and find some way to launch up onto the small ledge up and left.

Beyond the mantel, continue up the wandering cracks passing a bulge (and another old piton, probably also best skipped in favor of your own gear).

This may look dubious on sight, but the holds are there (like \\"Brinton\'s Direct\\") and there is even some gear.  For the final 6-8 feet, move left.  The top-out on the ledge is always dirty.    You could continue to the top of the bluff (5.7 or 5.8 I think), but most people stop here and walk off to the side toward the Leaning Tower gully.    Variations:  for the lowest part, you can TR on or just to the left of the rib\'s arete - it wouldn\'t make a great lead.

A very shallow yet good #1 C4 can be placed in the flare and protects the climber while pulling the roof. A piton waits above. Marginal, micro gear is available just before the big move ahead and a good placement is available right after. After the big move, do a short traverse left to a thin crack and prepare for a third crux section.","style":["crack","roof","powerful"]},{"id":117070065,"name":"Out of the Frying Pan","type":"Boulder","rating":"V3 PG13","stars":5,"starVotes":1,"pitches":"","location":["Wisconsin","Devil\'s Lake","West Bluff Bouldering","West Bluff Fire Road","North of Fire Road","The Firepit"],"url":"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/117070065/out-of-the-frying-pan","imgSqSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/117070190_sqsmall_1559619683.jpg","imgSmall":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/117070190_small_1559619683.jpg","imgSmallMed":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/117070190_smallMed_1559619683.jpg","imgMedium":"https://cdn-files.apstatic.com/climb/117070190_medium_1559619683.jpg","longitude":-89.7419,"latitude":43.4226,"climbingArea":"Wisconsin, Central Region","desc":"This is an extension of the roof climb, Into the Fire.

Well, I would call Astroboy one of the best multi-pitch trad climbs in the country, marred only by the fact that you have to walk back to the base after every pitch. Astroboy is arguably the classiest of the numerous Devil\'s Lake linkups.     The rule is pretty simple: Lead 10 different 5.10s on the East Rampart. But wait, you say, I can think of 5, 6, even 7 good 5.10 leads on the East, but 10, how can I find 10 leads? Therein lies the difficulty of Astroboy. You have to lead some routes that, let\'s be honest, you wouldn\'t normally think of leading. When was the last time you led The Monster? Or Mongo Fury (Burt, you don\'t count!)? Or Pine Box? And maybe consider adding Thoroughfare, because, I don\'t know about you, but I\'d rather lead Thoroughfare than, say, Big Deal.     Here\'s the order I chose for Astroboy:    1. Mongo Fury  2. Sometimes  3. Flake Route  4. Congrats  5. Pine Box (DON\'T tell me it\'s 5.9+)  6. Thoroughfare  7. Callipigeanous  8. Mouse\'s Misery  9. Cheatah  10. Alpha Centauri    But that\'s what I chose. Page through the guidebook, talk to your partner, and make your own plan. And then be prepared to change your plan when your chosen route is swarming with Boy Scouts. Also be prepared to hang out in the Cool Lot (is that even still a thing?) after your long day. Over beers and beta spray, casually remark that you climbed Astroboy, and that Pine Box wasn\'t so bad, and that Mongo Fury is a neglected classic, and that you just had one of your best days at the Lake.

I\'m talking about a \\"real\\" 5.12--not some obscure short climb at Horse Rampart or some corner over at Sandstone. I\'m talking about hard moves, tricky pro and mandatory runouts in groundfall territory. I\'m talking about a 5.12 that is a hair\'s breadth away from the mythical routes like Bagatelle whose leads only live in the memory of a few crazed souls. Yeah, you guessed it, I\'m talking about going All the Way.As with all 5.12 leads at DL, the stories about All the Way abound. Of course there was Deutchler\'s first ascent, which I didn\'t witness (I was two years old), but which I imagine taking place with a bunch of DLFAers sitting around, saying \\"Whoa man, that was groovy.\\" Tommy\'s ascent did pave the way for other groundbreaking ascents of the era, Bagatelle included. Then there\'s the time that Zschiesche headed up the climb with no gear, and asked bystanders to throw him up the needed pieces. This technique never seemed to catch on, as the hassle I\'m sure outweighed any weight savings. And finally, there was the time when I punted off the start crux moves, crashed into the arms of my spotters and may have broken, or seriously sprained, the finger of one willing spotter.To start the climb, locate the funky corner to the right of Congratulations. Climbing from the ground to the obvious hourglass hold presents the crux of the route. I thought it felt about V6, but I used spotters and crashpads, so feel free to judge me as not a true trad climber. There is no real pro until you stick the hourglass hold. Once you stick the hold, however, you must steel yourself for some heady climbing to reach the belay ledge of The Pedestal. This section feels 5.11ish, and you pass a welcome horizontal that offers a good rest and some nice pro. Above the horizontal, a small stopper protects the final hard move, which is just tenuous enough to keep your attention as you reach The Pedestal ledge.I\'m not sure how the original route finished, but I like to think that Deutchler forged straight up the wall above The Pedestal ledge. On my lead, I tried to stay true to the line and I headed up steep rock above the ledge up to the long-forgotten mini-route called The Trick.
