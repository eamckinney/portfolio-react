        longDescription: <p>This is a current project that I'm working on, where I have created a simple app that allows users to filter climbing routes by the route's style using key words sourced from the route's description. Most climbing guides allow users to filter by location, type, grade, and star-rating, but few if any allow people to filter by route style. My next goal is to create a machine learning algorithm to recommend routes that a user may like based on ratings and reviews of previous routes.</p>,

        longDescription: <p>I'm working with a local nonprofit to build a watershed and water guidelines visualization tool for architectural stormwater design and decision-making. The goal is to create a companion illustrative language for the textual sections of the Minnesota B3 Site and Water guidelines that focus on water at the district, site and building scale, as well as engage the public in the flow of water and put users in conversation with those responsible for designing public water systems. <br /><br /> This project is currently in development. Check back here at the end of 2021 for updates! The image below is an example skematic that has been drawn up for the proposal.</p>,
