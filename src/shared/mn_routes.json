        "desc": "Chinese Freedom is one of the best climbs at Red Wing, offering great technical climbing, bomber rock(for MN dolomite, that is), and two back to back cruxes that couldn't be more different in character. Twenty feet of crimpy climbing brings you to the cruxes.  The first is a delicate, improbable cross through off a flat undercling sloper.  The sloper can't really be grasped, just pushed up on by standing up, and crossing through seems ridiculous until you finally commit and go for it.  Many people, particularly those of a shorter stature, end up lunging at the end of the cross through; luckily the pockets you're reaching for are two of the most improbably perfect jugs you'll ever encounter on a route.  Shake out and clip from the jugs, then go for the next crux; a huge deadpoint dyno to a flat edge three or four feet above the holes.  This hold must be hit perfectly to prevent you're feet from popping off the nonexistent smears for feet.  Once through the second crux, easier climbing featuring a fist jam rest, the world's best two finger pocket, and a couple of perfect oxide crimps lead to one last long move to a jug at the anchors.",

Short, but powerful and sustained, with excellent moves on good rock; Living All Over Me is a change from the delicate, crimpy climbing that is so common on other hard routes at the bluff.  Flat edges lead from the ground to the first and overall crux of the climb; a powerful boulder problem pressing into a nasty gaston, getting into a tiny undercling, and then lunging for a great incut edge.  Shortly after, a rest is reached that allows you to shake out and chalk before committing to the second boulder crux; a powerful reach into a good undercling followed by a huge low percentage bump up and right to a good edge.  A few more moves up the arete and it's in the bag.  The true crux of the route lies in sticking the dicey lunge near the top despite the fatigue of sending the more powerful lower section.  Extremely solid at the grade by the bluff's standards, Living All Over Me is a true Red Wing classic.",

Very technical, crimpy, and pumpy; it climbs like a series of difficult boulder problems with hard moves coming all the way to a potentially bitter end.  Like many of the harder routes at the bluff this one seems much harder until you figure out all the little tricks.  Down low a long lockoff to a fingerlock sets you up for the first crux; either a big reach out left to bump off a very poor gaston or a wild three foot deadpoint all the way to the great incut edge up high.  A few more tricky moves brings you to an excellent rest just left of Barnburner.  The next fifteen feet of intense climbing takes you through a big stab out left for a pocket, powerful laybacking, and finally the crux of the climb: a traverse left to a decent rail.  For those fortunate few over about 6'3\" or with a ridiculous ape-index, the rail can be reached all the way from the decent holds out right.  Everyone else must bump using a slopey sidepull/pinch, a perpetually slimy crimp, and some worthless footholds with the difficulty inversely proportional to your height.  The sustained nature of this section makes it very tiring to link because of the difficulty of clipping the bolts.  A better option is to clip high and downclimb back to the good rest, then climb all the way from the jug to the rail without stopping, then clip the bolt at your knees.  This way saves precious energy but requires a little more psyche as you contemplate the whipper while crimping the life out of that slimy edge!  Once through the crux, it's not over yet.  Another difficult boulder problem from the rail finally gets you to a hold worth writing home about.  Ten more feet of moderate climbing leads to the anchors and, for most, the exhilarating experience of clipping the chains pumped out of your mind.  Phew!",

        "desc": "Paradigm Shift may be the ultimate Red Wing route.  There are certainly some harder climbs at the bluff, but none personify so well the nature of hard climbing at Red Wing; incredibly crimpy, super technical, and very temperature dependent.  The first 50 feet are incredibly sustained, with no real letup until you reach the jug at bolt six; from there to the top is relatively easy 5.10 climbing with ample opportunity to depump before sneaking through the band of choss on top to reach the anchors.  The bottom two thirds of the route consists of three very difficult boulder problems, each one harder than the last, linked by easier but extremely technical terrain.  The first powerful, crimpy boulder problem gets you to the second bolt and the bottom of the distinctive seam/crack that diagonals up the lower part of the wall.  The seam consists of super techy 5.11+ that may seem impossible until you find the right sequence of microscopic footholds to see you through.  At the end of the seam, the next boulder problem tackles a powerful gaston and match on a slopey rail to reach the large pocket which is much worse than it looks.  Make the difficult clip from the pocket, then move left to reach the \"rest\" at a four inch long, incut crimper.  I would not consider this a rest on any other route, but you take what you can get and this is far and away the best hold between the ground and the jug at 50 feet.  Shake out as best you can before tackling another ten feet of awkward, technical 5.11 climbing to reach the ultimate crux of the route and the hardest individual moves, right after the fifth bolt.  There are numerous sequences for the last boulder problem, but they invariably all use the same razor sharp 1/4 inch crimper, tiny iron oxide gaston high and right, and some combination of worthless ripples and pockets as intermediates to reach the flat, positive crimper that finishes this V5 sequence.  Bearing down on the sharp holds enough to stick the last moves as your forearms reach meltdown is, needless to say, a good test of pain tolerance and tenacity.  Two more big reaches will bring you to that \"thank god\" jug out right and the end of the difficulties.  Due to the thin, crimpy nature of this route, it's highly temperature dependent and nearly impossible during the humid summer months.  There has been some debate as to the grade of this route, given 12d in Farris's guidebook.  Everyone I talked to who has done this route or come close, with the exception of one, felt strongly that it warrants the bump to 13a.  In comparison to other hard Red Wing routes such as Living All Over Me and Mississippi Burning that are considered solid for their grades, Paradigm was a huge leap in difficulty and seems deserving of the bump.  It would be great to see more traffic on this route and a few more opinions about the grade.  Whatever the rating, the route is a classic and deserves to see more attention.",

There are possibilities for high gear placements to protect the traverse. The left variation starts below the ledge and goes straight up. Only one piece of gear protects the move onto the ledge. Follow the crack up left to a good rest. The crux gear is in solid rock and it is possible to get in 2 to 3 pieces to protect it. Keep hauling up the crack until you're under a large flake. Pull over the flake/bulge onto the face and clip the chains. Some loose rock sits behind the flake and could cause problems with clipping the chains if grabbed. Beware. Hard onsight.

        "desc": "Easily overlooked because of its longer, more popular neighbors to the right on the winter wall; Kelly's Arete offers superb, delicate climbing up the arete just to the left of Jam and Jelly.  Start up the crack until you can reach left and clip the first bolt.  At this point it is possible to move out onto the arete proper and begin the real climbing.  A good sidepull allows a long reach to clip the second bolt before beginning the crux, one of the best sequences you'll encounter at the bluff.  Reaching from a small left hand undercling, the right is bumped up the arete until a decent pinch is found.  Smearing the right foot against a ripple in the rock, the left is brought up to a good edge parallel with the undercling.  This position seems tailor made to generate an uncontrollable barndoor swing when the left hand is released, but with a deep dropknee you can release your hand just long enough to make an enormous reach to a slopey pocket up high.  A few desperate bumps and you can reach a decent hold around the arete to the right, leading to easier but still technical moves to reach the chains.  Unfortunately, clipping the third bolt is very difficult and comes right in the middle of the crux sequence, necessitating a horrible heelhook.  Some have chosen to skip the third bolt and climb through the crux before clipping.  This should be done with caution though, as a large fall is risked on a very short climb, and a grounder could occur.  Perhaps clipping the second bolt with a locking biner instead of a draw would help slightly, and obviously an attentive belayer is a must!  However you choose to do it, Kelly's Arete offers some of the bluff's most aesthetic climbing and should be high on everyone's ticklist.",

Red Wing laughed at this man's delusions, saying, \"blow torch, smore norch. these holds will always be greasy and chossy!\". With that, Mr. Engel punched the base of the route, thus creating the great two-finger pocket at its start. That guy has no ethics, brauh.    For the start, I recommend skipping the first bolt and just stick clipping the second, and have your belayer stand to your right. With this setup, you'll have an unobstructed throw for the undercling.    At a foot or so above the fourth bolt, there is a crumbling pinch (especially at it's base/bottom). Tread carefully, and don't blow -- or blame -- your RP on this, homie.    Takes five draws. Anchors have leaver biners -- and a dead bush that obstructs clipping!

Clip the next bolt while below it, obviously.  The crux is pulling the roof.  There is a definite sequence that makes it easier but it's still not easy.  If you're shorter than 5'10\" good luck.

Like Gandalf the Grey in the Two Towers, Chris Hirsch, another gangly wizard, shone light into the abyss.  Equipped only with a grigri and some Sobe iced tea, young Hirsch had the foresight -- nay, vision! -- to unearth (literally, this rig was dirty) -- another link-up at Willow, the Mono Mercy link.      Hence that fateful day, the skies at Willow have been bright (however the choss remains, the crowds are bigger, Hudson is still WT...you get the idea).  And, in honor of this great achievement, no one has since -- to this author's knowledge -- had the gall to climb this visionary piece of climbing history.  So, take up your staff (aka stick clips), grab some magic potions (aka a Sobe), and ride in and send.      Once attired in Gandalf robe and staff, begin on the Mono Route.  At the roof that guards the chains for this route, move left and directly tackle the crux of Rejection and Mercy.  Finish on Rejection and Mercy, clipping the lower chains (the top are unequalized, which is bad for your rope and for the higher anchor, which receives much more wear and tear than the lower).",

Because of the difficulty above and below, it can feel a bit odd to be on such easy terrain, but fret not: you are not off-route.    You will quickly find yourself on some big jugs with your feet not quite beneath you. Gain a rest that I didn't think really offered full recovery. Chalk a couple times, and just keep going.    The redpoint crux, is not as difficult as the lower crux, but it's still really fun.  Make long moves between good holds, and clip the anchors from jugs.  The perfect Red Wing route.",

I'm leaving again in about a year, and it would be nice if someone repeated this (and downgraded it to 12a) before I left. Someone step up for god's sake.     So the description I wrote in 2007:  The solid, orangey gold rock to the left of Fallen Knight: it consists of three small boulder problems where each one is harder than the last.  Starts with easy climbing up to a thin seam, which can be surmounted using a horizontal hand jam below, and making a high reach to good holds.  An easy deadpoint leads to a horizontal crack.    The next section is the most fun - long reaches between a blank arete and a couple of sloping crimps, with the wall steadily tilting a little more overhanging as you go.  This sets you up for the final six feet, and the crux, which involved some serious tomfoolery, not to mention a couple of weeks of doubt as to whether I would be able to do it.  Figuring out these moves was the most rewarding part of the process of putting up this route, so I'll leave the details out, but make sure to pull a couple of techy moves out of your quiver for the crux.   The last move is a nice little throw to the positive finish, and a boulder-style topout.  The grade is just a guess - it isn't as painful as nearby Genetic Control, but was harder for me, and took a little longer.    A fun toprope on good orange rock that doesn't feel like most of the Taylor's Falls stuff.  Ultimately, this is a route of entirely different character than anything else at the crag (and MN), and now a personal favorite.    ",

Then it's 11 crimpy to the next ledge, all on the face to the right of the second part of Jam and Jelly. It looks blank from below but it's all there. The second ledge is dirty and sandy and there is a tree in your way, which sort of adds to the charm. Pulling the next overhang on hidden jugs is the crux IMO. It's not a stellar route but if you're running out of 11's to climb this one is pretty good.  The book gives it 11+, but I think that's a little soft, 11b?.    RCM&W #40, p. 125",

This move is easier for tall folks. From the pocket, a tenuous move deposits the climber at a rest on a nice edge. Getting to the next rest, two huecos, requires lots of tension and precision. This is the physical crux of the route. After resting at the huecos, tricky moves lead to the last bolt, which is a little farther away than most would like. This is the redpoint/mental crux. From the last bolt, it's Red Wing sand jugs to the top. With desperate moves down though and some tenuous cruxing up high, crisp temps are extremely helpful for sending this rig.",

But if you are local, and need something after having done these routes, Rock Pigs is the climb for you.   The most powerful moves are at the start (which can be a little disquieting, if you don't know they're the hardest moves), and they give way to fun, pretty easy climbing for twenty feet or so.    The crux, illustrated vividly at right, is fun, and allows for some creativity. For a couple of suggestions for beta, check the comments below.  The rest of the route allows you to work on your climbing-shitty-rock-without-pulling anything-off skills.  Update: with about fifty times as many people able to climb 12+ in MN now, compared to when I climbed this, this route is getting a lot of attention, and is getting cleaner.  Next time someone gets on it, could you post information onthe status of its hardware?  That was its other black eye, for sure, when I did it.",

The V3 approach is sit starting off a small pocket (using any other holds within reach to assist) and climbing straight up, only to move right along a gritty shelf near the top to a solid finish. For a stronger burn, start off traversing right from the pocket then gradually upwards to end on the same topout holds as before (V4). This approach goes under the best crimps and uses only the right edge of the grit shelf for hands.  An all-around straightforward problem worthy of a little hype, Pocket of Pain puts your contact strength to the test and reveals any flaws (don't I know it) in one's big reach climbing technique.

On a busy day, hundreds walk through the gravelly spot below the wall, but the rare moment exists when climbing this route is a solitary experience, and the overhanging arbor and bubbling stream are electric.    Since it was first climbed, it has been top-roped countless times, led once (Mike Dahlberg - early 90's(?) - before the awesome thin cams of today), and bouldered (Andy Raether ~2001 - a bold ascent, given the landing [update: Word on the street (Adam Therneau) says that Nic and Chris H have also bouldered it - anyone else?]).  With appropriate equipment, sound judgment, and motivation, this route is accessible to many more climbers in any of the three styles.   Although short, it contains some of the most enjoyable movement of any route in the state.  The rock is solid, the holds are finger friendly (for a 12), and the spacing and position of the holds are not so outrageous that they disallow the emergence of character.    It's one of the easiest set-ups around too, with a five minute walk to the short cliff, a two minute walk to the top, and a five minute set-up.       Marvel at the fantastic movement, the killer hard, well-textured rock, the distinctly different character of the start and finish, and delight in the satisfying top-out. ",

It really should get more traffic, it's a fun bouldery problem.  Mind the spiders!    RCM&W #120, p. 138",

It basically starts on the face left of Call of the Mild, which starts in the old quarry groove and goes up the corner.  Although the ratings are the same in the book (since they link up at about 15 feet), this climb has a much harder start in my opinion, especially when it's humid out.  Those little crimps get pretty slimy.  It then follows the bolt line up high to a big ledge and traverses right to the Goofed anchors.  Aside from the beginning, the crux is about halfway up on a series of bad holds with little feet.  Don't go too far left and get off route into easier territory (I'm looking at you Bob and Isaac).

In all three cases, it may be advisable to either stick clip the first bolt or bring a pad and good spotter.    Once at the first bolt, climb up and right to second bolt and over block to a stance below the face.  For full value, stick to the moves on the face and eliminate the flake on your right.  Climb to a point below the overhang where you get a nice jug for your left hand in the crack to clip from (bolt not visible until you get the hold and lean out).  Climb jugs and final crimps on face directly below and right of anchors.

Very long reaches through very small crimps lead to a shallow mono and a brief rest before deciding how to handle the crux which has been done several ways. Most of the moves favor tall people.

This climb goes up the right-side arete. Use the obvious flat jug on the base of the arete as a sit start hold. Your 1st left foot is across the crack/gap and the 1st right foot is on the face you'll be climbing. For this route to be a V1 layback, use only the left edge of the arete for hands while keeping feet solely on the main boulder face off of arete/corner holds. Arete footholds while temping here, can throw your balance off and toss you into a set of jagged offwidth jaws. Ouch. Flagging a foot across the gap can be helpful at times though.  After pulling through a pinchy sit start sequence, the layback begins, making for solid, almost relaxed climbing up the boulder's side to a great topout hold - ends on a flat jug near the top.

Two recent sends (the most notable being Tyler Hoffart's second ascent 16 years after the first), however, have proved this thing not only goes, but is a great big ball of fun to climb as well. The line begins on an easy, left trending ramp to the far left side of the winter wall (think near NSP, Relentless, etc.). Basically, its the closest climbable line to the gully separating the winter wall and cyclops areas. You'll figure it out. After climbing the 5.5 ramp, take a break on the pedestal on top, then traverse right on two huecos into a sequence that seriously deserves a V-grade. Complete about 10 feet of hard, cool climbing which becomes rapidly more difficult as you move through it, until two stopper moves and an airy reach to a ledgy jug ends any difficulties. After a loud and energetic celebration (I think I screamed \"Yes!\" like 10 times), move up and right through slightly chossy 5.9 terrain to old anchors (shared with \"Longing for Miss Adonis\"). Lower, clean, revel in self awe- you sent this. You are special. You probably deserve a beer. Or the underage equivalent.",

In any case, you get to the crimpy crux pretty early on, near bolt 2, and once you work that out and get into the undercling at bolt 3, you are pretty much home free.

My girlfriend still scowls at me when she's reminded of my three tries on this route, and how she endured a crumbling hell belay for all three of them.

Unless a bunch of chalk gets sprayed on it, you won't be able to see how to finish the route, so just go up and throw yourself at it. The crux move is a long, low percentage throw to a nice, flat jug. The hardest part is how far away that big hold is. On-sight attempts are great fun on this thing.  If you miss the crux throw, you can downclimb to the rest, and try to think of what to do.  Shocking that the rock is good the whole way, when many of these rarely climbed twelves at Red Wing usually, and inexplicably, continue past the good rock and into the bad.    Would benefit from a carefully built trail to the base, and either a small platform dugout, or a belay bolt at the bottom.   ",

A slip will lead to a long ride to the ground!     This climb is an eliminate. None of the jugs or corner are on for your hands until above the \"triangle\" of the corner 10-12 feet up. What feet are \"on\" aren't necessarily clear. I was able to do it using just dishes/smears/heel hooking for feet, although you'll be desperate to keep your feet off the jugs at the crux! Remember, the only person you have to answer to is yourself (and your friends). :)     Bolts were added after the first ascent; I'm not certain who did, and suspect that it was without the consent of the first ascentionist, though I don't know for certain.

This was the route we climbed at the end of the day to pull ropes off many of the other climbs. We usually climbed it in the dark with hiking boots, too worn out from laps on Barn Burner to even bother switching to climbing shoes.     It is still a fun climb, and a safe, but challenging lead for the novice 5.9 leader. The climb runs left of the bolt line on Roof Burner, climbing the left corner of the roof, moving directly up and sharing the Roof Burner bolts. At the last bolt, there is an intimidating but fairly simple (5.7) left angled upward traverse to the Barn Dance anchors. From here, you can toprope Dead Dog Face if you so desire. From the last bolt you can also move right instead to finish on the Roof Burner anchors.     Alternately you can use the bolts on Dead Dog Face, but the last bolt takes you a long way off of the Barn Dance line.     Some feel the crux is pulling the roof, others find it in the dirty pockets following the roof. In either case, the holds are there, you just have to find them...     FYI, there is an alternate finish to the Roof Burner Bolts that is longer and also probably 5.9.  It seems many people are climbing that as Roof Burner, but they are not the same route.

I'll also take some better pics next time I'm out there.     On the north side of the boulder, starting about 5 feet or so to the left of the mini-cave, sit-start with your hands on a long sloping ledge, then heel hook the ledge as you move hands up and match on the next big sloper (that's right before the left end of the mini-cave). Move your heel hook up, then flag your right leg out to an obviously good foot placement on the right side of the cave as you reach up for an obvious jug just above the mini-cave (slightly to the left-center above the cave). Then top out by following a small ridge line of slopers, pinches, and jug up and slightly to the left).     It's a really fun problem, and one of the few that I've seen so far on the boulder where you really rely on a couple of strong heel hooks. I was the only one to do it when I was out there, so the rating may not be right.",

It combines the difficult initial moves of \"Start of Something Good\" with, immediately after, a harder crux of its own: a traverse right on small slopers ending in a good mail-slot jug. The heinous moves are well-worth it though, because what follows is arguably the best 5.11 face climbing Red Wing has to offer. Did you like climbing the upper part of \"Start of Something Good\"? Well, in case you did, this one is more difficult, more sustained, more fun. Never mind the loose rock -- the moves are killer! Go, suffer through the first three bolts if only to experience the joy of climbing up higher. A great alternative on crowded days at Winter Wall: there's hardly anybody ever on this route.",

The belayer should stay at the base near the bottom of Pigeon Paranoia. Clip the first bolt before leaving the pedestal. At the last bolt, the 10c variation involves moving slightly right. The 11c variation (Coronation Blues Direct) goes straight up after clipping the last bolt via a very poor side-pull and a shallow pocket, avoiding any handholds to the right of the last bolt.The scree gully approach to the back of the second pedestal is the site of frequent rockfall, especially in winter and spring, so heads up.\u00a0",
