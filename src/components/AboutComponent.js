                                    What do people even write in these sections? How do I tell you about myself without sounding arrogant or clich√©?
                                    I will try to keep it simple.

                                    At the center of who I am, <b>I really like to solve puzzles and learn new things.</b> Right now, that is taking 
                                    shape by learning how to write Python code and be a project manager at a gender research + tech startup called Equilo,
                                    by helping companies understand how people make decisions as a freelance quantitative brand strategist, and 
                                    by fiddling around with JavaScript, React, APIs, and machine learning "for fun."
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    I will leave it at that. If you're intrigued, drop me a line. I'd rather chat with you 
                                    than give everything away on this website, anyway. I hope to hear from you.
